# Weather Dash

#### I am building a weather dashboad using R with an emphasis on the Shiny and GGplot2 packages.

A working copy of the dashboard can be found at: https://austincauthon.shinyapps.io/weather_dash/

My next steps include:
  1. Making the line graph for wind speed more visually pleasing.
  2. Taking the raw text output on the lower right and formatting it into a table.
  3. Adding a weather comparison tool. The goal is to take the current forecast in the target zip and then return a far away location that experiences that weather on a regular basis. For example, Kansas City may be experiencing a cool, windy, and low humidity day which may be a typical spring day for Wellington, New Zealand.
